 What are the features of React?
 
 JSX:  JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.

Virtual DOM: React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.

One-way data-binding: React’s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means that when designing a React app, you often nest child components within parent components.

High performance: React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once. This results in much faster web applications.


---------------------------------------


 Can web browsers read JSX directly? 
 
 Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object 
For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel


------------------------

What is the virtual DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.

What is an event in React?

An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML.
With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.
<Button onPress={lightItUp} />

--------------------------------------

What are synthetic events in React?

Synthetic events combine the response of different browser's native events into one API, ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.
The application is consistent regardless of the browser it is running in. 
Here, preventDefault is a synthetic event.
stopPropagation()

Why is there a need for using keys in Lists?

Keys are very important in lists for the following reasons:

A key is a unique identifier and it is used to identify which items have changed, been updated or deleted from the lists
It also helps to determine which components need to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering all the components every time. Therefore, it increases performance, as only the updated components are re-rendered

----------------------------------------

 What is the use of render() in React?
 
It is required for each component to have a render() function. This function returns the HTML, which is to be displayed in the component.
If you need to render more than one element, all of the elements must be inside one parent tag like <div>, <form>.

----------------------------------------

What is a state in React?

The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events. It determines the behavior of the component and how it will render.

---------------------------------------------

What are props in React?

Props are short for Properties. It is a React built-in object that stores the value of attributes of a tag and works similarly to HTML attributes.
Props provide a way to pass data from one component to another component. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments are passed in a function.

-----------------------------------------

What are the differences between state and props?


---------------------------------

What is a higher-order component in React?

A higher-order component acts as a container for other components. This helps to keep components simple and enables re-usability. They are generally used when multiple components have to use a common logic.

----------------------------------

 Explain the lifecycle methods of components.
 
 getInitialState(): This is executed before the creation of the component.
componentDidMount(): Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
shouldComponentUpdate(): Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a “true” or “false” value based on certain conditions.
componentDidUpdate(): Is invoked immediately after rendering takes place.
componentWillUnmount(): Is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.

  What is Redux?
  
  Redux is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the application state. React uses Redux to build the user interface. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used for the entire application’s state management.
  
  ------------------------
  
  What are the components of Redux?
  
Store: Holds the state of the application.
Action: The source information for the store.
Reducer: Specifies how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

----------------------------------

What is the Flux?

Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building web applications. It is a method of handling complex data inside a client-side application and manages how data flows in a React application.

There is a single source of data (the store) and triggering certain actions is the only way way to update them.The actions call the dispatcher, and then the store is triggered and updated with their own data accordingly.

When a dispatch has been triggered, and the store updates, it will emit a change event that the views can rerender accordingly.
